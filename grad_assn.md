Report Due: Friday, one week after class ends,11:59pm** as a Github commit. We mark the last commit unless told otherwise.

DM me your suggested topic/format by Oct 1. I reserve the right to veto your topic. 

Note:

* Assignments are to be completed individually.
* Format your submission as a Markdown document. 

## Presentation Guidelines

* marks will be deducted if not followed
* First page should be a cover page that indicates your name and student number, title of your project, and a table of contents for the document.
* Include page numbers, i.e. 1 of 10 and your name 
* Include clear section headings that match the assignment description
* Support your assertions with reference to specific lines of code or document sections. Cite this using hyperlinks. For example, "ActionView's [prepare_context](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7ca3ab415d409ba39b07ff5a96da06d68098069b/actionview/lib/action_view/context.rb#L22) method has a potential buffer underflow problem"

# Overview
One of:
- Choose a current paper discussing software architecture/documentation/design issues, from a reputable academic venue (ICSE/ISSTA/RE/ICSA/FSE/ASE/TSE/TOSEM/JSS). Summarize and present to the class. 
- Prepare a submission to the DysDoc Declutter challenge or Summarization Challenge. Report results in class. 


# Possible topics:

- software design in the software 2.0 era
- automatically generated documentation
- pick an existing software design paper (e.g., from MSR, ICSA, ICSE) and replicate the findings. 
- microservice migration
- automated design problem detection
- formal analysis of software designs with verification tools like Coq, TLA+, Alloy
- port existing OO code to functional/prototype paradigms
- something discussed with me in advance

# Deliverables
* For a research focus, a 3000 word or so report (i.e., approx 8 pages for a conference paper). Use PDF OR Jupyter Notebook.
* For DysDoc focus, a design doc + a tool Omar and I can use. We will schedule a demo time in the week following end of term. 

# Marking Rubric
The report will be judged on the basis of scientific quality (novel topic, validated conclusions, proper scientific writing style).

The tool will be judged on novelty, software quality (both internal (architecture/design) and external (usability, usefulness)) and documentation support.
